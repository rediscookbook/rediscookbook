### Problem

You want to be able to:

* Install Redis on a Linux, OS X, or a similar Posix operating system
* Use a standardized layout for configurations and binary locations
* Have a /etc/{init.d,rc.d}/redis system control script when installing as root
* Install to one or more remote hosts
* Have the ability to install locally using *one* command

### Solution

Use [redis-installer](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/redis-installer/). With redis-installer, you can install on localhost in two commands, install on localhost with just one command, or easily install Redis into multiple environments. Here's how to do each:

To install on localhost, first, download and/or clone the redis-installer:

	git clone git://github.com/wayneeseguin/redis-installer/

Next, actually install Redis:

	bin/install-redis

To install on localhost with just one command, use this simple `bash`
one-liner. Repeat: "I am not lazy, I am efficient!"

	bash < <(curl https://github.com/wayneeseguin/redis-installer/raw/master/bin/install-redis)

Finally, to install on multiple remote hosts, download and/or clone the redis-installer:

	git clone git://github.com/wayneeseguin/redis-installer/

Then install Redis on one or more remote hosts like so:

	bin/install-redis-on-hosts hostname1 [hostname2 [hostname3 ...]]

### Discussion

Note that installation and configuration is different based on whether you install as root or install as user. For root, it installs Redis to /usr/local/ and for a user it installs to ~/.redis/

Solution 2 simply downloads the Redis installer script, and feeds it directly into `bash` to execute the commands.

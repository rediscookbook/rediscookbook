### Problem
You want tags for your objects, and want to be able to search them.
<<<<<<< HEAD
This recipe is loosely based on this presentation: http://www.slideshare.net/gleicon/redis-3025589

### Solution
In this case, using books as an example, create one SET for each tag, and associate the given ids to the correct sets.
Selecting a combination between tags is simple as using SINTER, SUNION and SDIFF.
The same principle can be used for document storage, taking care to use words or its stems as 'tags'

In redis-cli:

    SET book:1 {'title' : 'Diving into Python',
    'author': 'Mark Pilgrim'}
    SET book:2 { 'title' : 'Programing Erlang',
    'author': 'Joe Armstrong'}
    SET book:3 { 'title' : 'Programing in Haskell',
    'author': 'Graham Hutton'}

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> upstream/master
    SADD tag:python 1
    SADD tag:erlang 2
    SADD tag:haskell 3
    SADD tag:programming 1 2 3
    SADD tag computing 1 2 3
    SADD tag:distributedcomputing 2
    SADD tag:FP 2 3

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> upstream/master
Now, the searching/selecting part:

    a)  SINTER 'tag:erlang' 'tag:haskell'
        0 results

    b)  SINTER 'tag:programming' 'tag:computing'
        3 results: 1, 2, 3

    c)  SUNION 'tag:erlang' 'tag:haskell'
        2 results: 2 and 3

    d)  SDIFF 'tag:programming' 'tag:haskell'
        2 results: 1 and 2 (haskell is excluded)

### Discussion

<<<<<<< HEAD
    SETs and ZSETs operations are building blocks for basic and advanced combinations which yields more results per search.
    
    In (a), there is no book tagged erlang AND haskell. 
    (b) is the same as searching for ALL BOOKS tagged programming and computing
    BOOKS that are tagged either erlang or haskell are found on (c)
    (d) excludes all books tagged haskell from the programming group.

    For a document based storage and search, check meta code at http://github.com/gleicon/docdb, but basically it would abuse SETs treating each word stem as a tag.
    It may look overkill, but after some documents, the number of sets doesnt grow that much. See slides 13 and 14 of presentation.
